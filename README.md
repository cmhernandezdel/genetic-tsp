Genetic algorithm to solve Traveling Salesman Problem.

<h2> The problem </h2>
Travelling Salesman Problem is a classic problem in theoretical computer science. It asks the following question: "If you were a salesman and had to travel to a list of cities, visiting each once and returning to the first, which would be the optimal route to minimize distance?"

This is a classic example of NP-hard problem, and it is important in optimization tasks.

The problem has many variants: for example, distance from A to B can be not equal to distance from B to A (for example, if we were to minimize the cost of plane tickets).
